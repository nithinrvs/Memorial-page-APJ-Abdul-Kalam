        <h2>India's Nuclear Tests at Pokhran</h2>
        <p>
            In 1998, India conducted a series of nuclear tests at the Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. 
            These tests, code-named "Operation Shakti," made India a recognized nuclear weapon state. 
            Dr. Kalam was at the forefront of these tests, providing scientific leadership and guidance.
        </p>

        <h2>Dr. Kalam's Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, a brilliant aerospace engineer and scientist, played a pivotal role 
            in the design and development of the nuclear devices used in the tests. His expertise and 
            dedication to India's defense and scientific progress were instrumental in the success of the 
            Pokhran tests.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Kalam's contributions to India's nuclear program are just one aspect of his remarkable career. 
            He went on to become the President of India and remained an inspiration to millions with his vision 
            for a prosperous and technologically advanced India.
